<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/712?utm_source=freewebsitetemplates&utm_medium=template_banner&utm_term=design&utm_content=ma_html_fwt_temp_3_4_tokyodesign&utm_campaign=ma_fwt&experiment_id=ma_html_fwt_temp_3_4_tokyodesign">Tokyo Design</a></p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>Good use of blank space to direct user’s eye to the main statement with bold colored circles with content categories.  Everything is oversized and simplistic.  Starting with the large font with an intriguing statement urging the user to the oversized circle buttons below to learn more.  The menu is in the far upper corner and significantly smaller than the other text, however the amount of blank space and balance of the text area draws focus to it immediately. </p>
	
	<p>This is exactly what type of website I want to create.  Again, I really enjoy the circle icons in bold colors.  The user’s eye is immediately drawn to the colors, as the rest of the page is blank space and neutral colors.  The important statement is in oversized text above the colored circles.  The menu is simple, and balanced over the right column of the page; yet it is in a small print compared to the majority of text.  Like Tokyo Design, the blank space around the menu options creates focal point to the menu. </p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>These websites are <ins>similar</ins> because:</p>
		<li><ul>They both use large bright colored circles.</ul></li>
		<li><ul>They both use oversized text.</ul></li>
		<li><ul>They both use a good amoount of whitespace to focus user's eye on important info.</ul></li>
		<li><ul>Both utilize off set double columns allowing the users to focus on the images and <i>then </i>read info.</ul></li>
		<li><ul> I really enjoy their use of keeping a consistant colors highlighting important information and leading them through the page.  </ul></li>
	<p>These websites are <ins>different</ins> because:</p>
		<li><ul>Tokyo uses images in the circles to help indicate content. </ul></li>
		<li><ul>The logo of Tokyo is not a focal point, however, Nicola's image is the main focal point. </ul></li>
		<li><ul>Nicola has more empty space and smaller text, which is less overwhelming than Tokyo who has such bigger text and less white space. </ul></li>
		<li><ul>Tokyo uses <i> a lot </i>more images than Nicola and completely fills the screen creating distinct sections. </ul></li>
		<li><ul>Nicola has an excesive amount of free space to influence users to engage with her. </ul></li>
<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<p><ins>Resume Page<ins></p>
	<ul><img src="Home Page.img" alt="Resume Page" width="460"></ul>
	<li><ul><p>The focal point of this page is to direct the user to the logo and information in the center of the page.  I added extra blankspace around that area to help guide the eye towards the center as well.  The page will have a smaller version of the main logo in the bottom center to help indicate it as a home page button. Bright colors will also aid in focusing attention to the icons. </p></ul></li>
	<p><ins>About Me Page<ins></p>
	<ul><img src="About Me Page.img" alt="About Me Page" width="460"></ul>
	<li><ul><p>The image on this page is balanced with the text in the second column on top of a potential third text box with significantly less whitespace. The title box is not as important as the content, so I kept it smaller.  I want the users to be engaged and interested in the content. I will use color and size to bring attention to important keywords and phrases. </p></ul></li>
	<p><ins>My Work Page<ins></p>
	<ul><img src="My Work Page.img" alt="My Work Page" width="460"></ul>
	<li><ul><p>This page has a three column layout with no text to influence the user's engagement in my projects I have done and get a visual understanding to back up the info. The images will be clickable for separate detailed pages. </p></ul></li>
